## Client-side (Frontend) Setup:

1.Install React in the client directory by running the command: npm install react.
2.Set up your React project and start building your frontend components to interact with the AI Photo Generator.
## Server-side (Backend) Setup:

1.Install Express in the server directory by running the command: npm install express.
2. Set up your Express server to handle API requests and interact with the OpenAI models for generating AI photos.

## Connecting the Client and Server:
1.Ensure your client and server directories are in the same project folder.
2.Use to make HTTP requests from the client to the server's API endpoints.
## Integrating OpenAI & Databasae:

1.Follow the documentation and guidelines provided by OpenAI to integrate their models into your server-side code.
2.Utilize the power of OpenAI's models to generate AI photos based on user input or specific requirements.
